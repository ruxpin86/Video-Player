## Description

This was a good exercise in understanding how to utilize HTML video elements. My goal was to get a handle on how to use Javascript to imitate other video players I have seen throughout the web and implement features like: showing playback progress, scrubbing video, skipping incrementally by predetermined set amounts of time, playing and pausing video, controlling playback rate, and control playback volume within the browser window.
